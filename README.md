### Developing an Audit Script according to CIS benchmarks with an easy to use Cross-Platform GUI

- This cross-platform application enables users and admins to perform
  Security Audits according to the CIS Benchmarks in Windows 11/ Ubuntu
  22.04 LTS / RHEL systems and their server counterparts .
- The application supports both standalone and admin-triggered audit
  executions. In both scenarios, audit reports and logs are stored locally, with
  the admin-triggered mode additionally transmitting these artifacts to the
  Admin System for centralized review.
- These Bash/PowerShell scripts are executed concurrently, leveraging multi
  core architecture to check and validate multiple benchmarks
  simultaneously, achieving high-speed audits. The generated reports
  accurately reflect the machine's security posture in accordance with CIS
  Benchmarks.
